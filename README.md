# PowerBI_Dashboard

For this project I downloaded a sample dataset of a bike manufacturer operating world wide. My goal was to create a useful dashboard for top management, allowing them to have a broad overview of international sales and business development. However, they should also be able to drilldown and -through into more specific aspects such as regional performances and customer views.

Here are the steps:

1. I started with formulating some user stories to set the goal and requirement of the project

2. Based on that, I performed some simple queries out of SQL Server to use the data within Power BI

3. I added an Excel File with some made up budgets for sales to enrich the data from the dataset

4. I built a data model within Power BI

5. Finally, I ended up with a useful dashboard. -> The pbix file can be found [here](https://maxemmrich.github.io/PowerBI_Dashboard/)
